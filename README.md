# Ray Tracing

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the power and beauty of ray tracing to create realistic 3D graphics. With a clean, minimal setup from Walnut, this application uses fundamental ray tracing techniques to render stunning scenes with accurate lighting, shadows, and reflections.

## Current technical features
* Ray Tracing Fundamentals: Implements essential ray tracing techniques, including ray-object intersection, shadows, and reflections.
* Realistic Lighting: Captures realistic light behavior to illuminate scenes beautifully, featuring emissive material to act as a light source.

## Screenshots
* Pic 1 & 2: light and shadow with emissive material
* Pic 3: spheres of different matierals (diffuse, emissive, mirror)
